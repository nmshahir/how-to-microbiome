# how-to-microbiome
Repository of microbiome / microbial ecology resources. 
I want this to be a "living" resource, so if you feel something is missing and/or know a resource that isn't included?
Leave an [issue](https://github.com/nmshahir/how-to-microbiome/issues) or even better a [pull request](https://github.com/nmshahir/how-to-microbiome/pulls) !
